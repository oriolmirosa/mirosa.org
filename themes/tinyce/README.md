You can check the live version [here](http://roperzh.github.io/tinyce-hugo-theme/).

Getting started
===

Once you have hugo up and running you must:

Create a hugo project:

```bash
$ hugo new site my-site
```

And then install tinyce:

```bash
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/roperzh/tinyce-hugo-theme
```

Now you can set tinyce as the default theme for your site adding this line
in the `config` file:

```toml
theme = "tinyce"
```

Or you can start the server with:

```bash
hugo server --theme=tinyce --buildDrafts --watch
```

Setting Variables
===

Tinyce needs a custom archetype in order to work properly, behind the covers
you will only need to define two new variables in the front matter section of
your contents.

- **color** : the color associated with the post, valid colors are: `red`,
`green`, `blue`, `yellow`, `orange` and `grey`.

- **icon** : a valid font-awesome icon name, without the `fa-` prefix, for example
instead of `fa-heart`, you only need to put `heart`. [here](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/)
is a cheatsheet of valid icons.

***Example***

```toml
+++
Categories = ["Development", "GoLang"]
Description = "My short description"
Tags = ["Development", "golang"]
color = "green"
icon = "heart"
title = "go is cool"
date = 2014-08-09T05:04:40Z
+++

```
