My research interests focus on global and transnational sociology, with emphasis on the environment and social movements. I am also generally interested in political sociology, sociology of organizations, sociology of development, Marxism and class analysis, and the sociology of knowledge.

My dissertation studies how water policy travels between the global and the local levels. I am interested in how poor people access clean water in developing countries. In the last three decades there have been radical changes in how we see water and how water is managed around the world. This is due to the work by some global organizations (such as the World Bank) which pushed forward the idea that water should be managed as an economic good, instead of as a public good, an entitlement or a right, as it had often been the case in the past. This new view of water was associated with specific policies, such as full-cost recovery or the privatization of water provision, which in many cases had detrimental consequences for the access to water of vulnerable populations.

My dissertation attempts to make sense of these changes and their implications by studying the specific cases of water provision in Bolivia and South Africa in the last three decades, as well as by researching the role of global institutions in generating and spreading knowledge and specific views about water and how it should be managed. I am particularly interested in how the effects of these policies spurred social mobilization at the local level, and how the ideas and demands from these movements in turn affect global processes.

Thanks to the Social Science Research Council's International Dissertation Research Fellowship I spent most of 2008 doing fieldwork in Bolivia and South Africa, as well as interviewing officials from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Global Water Partnership, and other global institutions that deal with water.
